FakeOS is a captivating project that showcases my proficiency in HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. It is an innovative virtual operating system that demonstrates my deep understanding and mastery of web development.

In this project, I was able to create the following mobile applications:
- Horoscope App which asks the user to input their name and birthday and generate a horoscope reading from such information.
- Monthly Planner App which let the users add tasks/plans to each month 
- Gallery App which allows the user to navigate through individual images in the gallery
